# DB-Project-1
TODO: include "pictures" relationship set

1. PostgreSQL database account: mc5090

2. application url

3. Implementation of proposal: From the original proposal, we implemented be able to browse products based on item type ("Shop by category" tab) or brand ("Shop by brand" tab). We also allowed users to create an account ("Register" tab accessible on the home page) and to log in (also on the home page). No password is required; we simply check that the input username is one that is in our database. Once logged in, the user can leave reviews on items, connect with other users, message them, and make text posts. If logged in, on an item page, a user can add the item with a quantity to their cart. The user can also enter the "Cart" tab to see the contents of their cart and previous orders, which includes the items that were in each order. If the user clicks "order" they can order what is currently in their cart.

Additional implementation: We added some functionality that allowed for more comprehensive interaction with the database and a more logical and completed web app. This includes: a profile tab that shows the user their input information, a settings tab that allows the user to add a new address and specify their birthday and size preference, a newsfeed on the home page that shows your posts, being able to remove a review once you have posted it on item pages, and being able to add a new address on the checkout page.
