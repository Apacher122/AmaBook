AmaTube (Social media e-commerce combo)
  //Description
  Our project will be an online store where verified major retailers can sell their products
  and which includes certain social media functionalities like connecting to other users and
  making posts. Users can browse the catalogue of items, add them to their cart to order them,
  and leave reviews. Additionally, users can connect to each other, message each other, and
  make their own posts.
  Entities: Users, Addresses, Messages, Products, Orders, Reviews, Photobase
  Relationships: connected_to, sends, has_in_cart, pictures, contains_item, is_similar_to,
  ordered, includes_photo, lives_at, ships_to
  
  
  //DATA-PLAN
  *include something about using historical data from existing websites*
  
  //USER-INTERACTION PLAN
  The user can browse the catalogue of items based on item type and see reviews (which
  can include photos) left on them. Given an account, a user can leave their own reviews
  as well as connect with other users. They can also make their own posts.
  
  
  
  //CONTINGENCY PLAN
  Should one or the other group members become unable to participate in the group project,
  the project will have to be downscaled to make the project feasible for one person. 
  Downscaling will entail reducing the amount of entities, app features, and simplifying
  front-end design.
