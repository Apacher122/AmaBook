AmaTube (Social media e-commerce combo)
  //Description
  Our project will be an online store where verified major retailers can sell their products
  and which includes certain social media functionalities. Users can browse the catalogue of
  items by type, add them to their cart to order them, and leave reviews. Additionally,
  users can connect to each other, message each other, and make their own posts.
  Entities: Users (sub-entity sets Retailers and Consumers), Addresses, Messages, Products,
  Orders, Reviews, Photobase
  Relationships: connected_to, sends, has_in_cart, pictures, contains_item, is_similar_to,
  ordered, includes_photo, lives_at, ships_to
  
  //PROJECT TYPE
  Web front-end option
  
  
  //DATA-PLAN
  Potentially take product information from existing mall sites
  Supplement with mock data
  
  //USER-INTERACTION PLAN
  The user will be a consumer who can browse the catalogue of items based on item type and
  see reviews (which can include photos) left on them. Given an account, a user can leave
  their own reviews, connect with other users and message them, and make their own posts.
  With an account, the user can also add products to their shopping cart and "order" them,
  then check the status of their orders.
  Retail-side interactions will not be shown.
  
  
  
  //CONTINGENCY PLAN
  Should one or the other group members become unable to participate in the group project,
  the project will have to be downscaled to make the project feasible for one person. 
  Downscaling will entail reducing the amount of entities, app features, and simplifying
  front-end design.
