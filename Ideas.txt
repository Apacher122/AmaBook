  //DESCRIPTION
  This application will follow the format of a typical social media website.
  The only difference between this application and, say, facebook would be that
  this application is more media-focused. The database will contain users, posts, 
  messages, media, and comments - all of which should uniquely be identified to 
  the user of origin. All entities, besides the user, will contain a date field 
  that displays time and date of submissions. The user will have fields that 
  contain identity, passwords, contact information, and the ability to disclose 
  gender and/or age. The media allowed for submission
  
  The relationships will include users "connecting" to each other, being able to see
  posts depending on "connection" status (essentially the same as adding a friend on fb), 
  sending messages to other users, and submitting posts.
  The challenging part to this task would be how to handle friends lists and their ability
  to see posts depending on friend status.
  
  For this project, we will follow the front-end web-design option.
  
  
  //USER-INTERACTION PLAN
  The users will be allowed to add friends and see their posts, be able to message anyone
  on the platform, share media, and receive recommendations for media. The platform is
  designed so that all media is shared publicly, unless otherwise specified (i.e. the user
  only wants to share among friends). In this way, the platform is like a hybrid between
  facebook and youtube in that users can easily interact and connect with friends, while
  focusing on creating and sharing content. There will be an additional database that will
  contain recommendations for media shared by users that will allow users of similar tastes
  to connect more easily.
